# Matsune Hiku's Wesbite

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the skills I have learned in React. The application is supposed to represent a mock website for a finctional singer/artist named Matsune Hiku. The project is built using mostly React.

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Open the Terminal within the project and type: `$ npm install react-router-dom@5` (Note we are installing v5 and not v6)
3. Then type within the Terminal: `$ json-server --watch db.json`
4. Opening a new terminal (do not close the previous) type: `$ npm start`
5. When prompted with `Would you like to run the app on another port instead?` type `Y`

The website should automatically open and is fully functional. If the website does open for whatever reason, in the same terminal you ran `npm start` you will see a local website (`http://localhost:`). Simply navigate to that website. 

## Usage

The application is designed to function as website so feel free to navigate it as such. There are tabs to help you navigate through different parts of the web app. `Home` is the home page and will display some information about Hiku. `Songs` will display a list of Hiku's songs. Each song will display the name, duration, genre, and a link to `see more`. When the link is clicked, you will be navigated to the song page where you will also see a brief description of the song. `New Song` will display a form where Hiku can add more songs to `Songs`. Upon completing the form you will be automatically navigated to the song's page.
